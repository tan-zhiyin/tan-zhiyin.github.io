        <p>RDF, RDFS, and OWL</p>
        <p>Standards and languages that form the backbone of the semantic web. They expand on the ontology concept to allow for rich, structured, and linked data across the web.</p>
        <p>RDF is the base layer, representing data as triples. RDFS provides a basic typing system to this. OWL adds more complexity, allowing for detailed ontologies with constraints and relationships.</p>

            Semantic Web
            <br>An extension of the current web, aiming to provide a standardized way to represent knowledge, making it understandable by machines.
            <br>uses structures like RDF, OWL, etc., to allow machines to understand and reason with web content.
