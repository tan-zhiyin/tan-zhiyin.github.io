            Community Detection
            <br>Identifying groups of nodes in a graph that are more densely connected with each other than with the rest of the graph.
        </li>
        <li>
            Graph Embedding
            <br>Converting nodes, edges, or entire graphs into continuous vectors to facilitate machine learning tasks.
