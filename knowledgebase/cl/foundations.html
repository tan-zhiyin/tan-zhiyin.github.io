                        Natural Language Processing (NLP) originated in the mid-20th century with the advent of machine translation, like the 
                        <a href="https://aclanthology.org/www.mt-archive.info/Garvin-1967.pdf" target="_blank">Georgetown-IBM experiment (1954)</a>, 
                        and information retrieval systems. Initial NLP systems, such as 
                        <a href="https://www.masswerk.at/elizabot/" target="_blank">Weizenbaum's ELIZA (1966)</a> 
                        and 
                        <a href="https://hci.stanford.edu/~winograd/shrdlu/" target="_blank">Winograd's SHRDLU (1972)</a>,
                         employed manual rule-based approaches. Despite the domain limitations and scalability challenges, these pioneering systems illustrated that human-machine interaction via natural language was achievable.

                        <span class="bolded">Chomsky's Influence & Dependency Grammar's Emergence</span><br>
                        Noam Chomsky's transformational grammar, proposed in "Syntactic Structures" (1957), shaped NLP's early syntax phase, preparing ground for syntax-based NLP systems. Concurrently, dependency grammar gained recognition, emphasizing word relationships over phrase structure. Lucien Tesni√®re's significant contributions (1959) were later complemented by statistical methods from Eisner (1996), enhancing tasks like machine translation and sentiment analysis. Both theories underpin the diversity of linguistic theory in NLP.

                        <span class="bolded">Statistical, Machine Learning and Deep Learning in NLP</span><br>
                        In the late 1980s, NLP shifted towards statistical methods, epitomized by Jelinek and Mercer's work on statistical language models at IBM (1980). This change leveraged data and probabilities, veering away from handcrafted rules, improving areas like speech recognition and machine translation. In the 21st century, deep learning techniques, such as Collobert and Weston's convolutional neural networks (2008) and Mikolov et al.'s word embeddings (2013), facilitated end-to-end language processing. Recent transformer models, like Vaswani et al.'s Transformer (2017), Devlin et al.'s BERT (2018), and Radford et al.'s GPT (2018), revolutionized NLP, enabling breakthroughs across tasks with their attention mechanisms.

                        <span class="bolded">Current State & Future Directions of NLP</span><br>
                        Contemporary NLP research focuses on model understanding, fairness, interpretability, and low-resource languages, guided by large-scale pretraining and transfer learning. Future developments will likely emphasize multilingual and cross-modal understanding, efficiency enhancements, and the ethical dimensions of language technology. These frontiers represent the most exhilarating future directions in NLP.

                    Linguistics thrives on the fundamental curiosity: "How does language work?".

                    thus deepening our understanding of human cognition and interaction.

                    Morphology focuses on the internal structure of words. A single word can be composed of many meaningful units called morphemes, 
                    including roots, prefixes, and suffixes. By examining how these morphemes combine, 
                    we understand the rules of word formation in different languages, how words evolve over time, 
                    and the intricate system governing the use of these word parts to convey nuanced meanings.

                    Syntax focuses on the rules and structure that govern the formation and arrangement of sentences in a particular language. It investigates the patterns and systems that allow us to combine words into grammatically correct sentences. This can include how different types of words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.) interact, how they can be arranged, and the relationships between different elements within a sentence. These insights are crucial for many language-related fields, including language teaching and learning, translation, and artificial intelligence.

                    Semantics is all about meaning in language. It studies how words, phrases, and sentences relate to the things they denote, or their referents. The field considers questions like why the word "dog" refers to a specific animal, how sentences express complex relationships between entities, or how the meaning of a phrase can be more than the sum of its parts. Semantics provides a bridge between the linguistic forms and the concepts they represent in the human mind.

                    Pragmatics explores the ways in which context influences language use and interpretation. It considers both the physical context (like where and when the conversation is happening) and the social context (like the relationship between speakers). The field investigates why we might choose one word over another in a particular situation, how we use language to achieve social goals, and how we interpret ambiguous statements. Pragmatics underlines the fact that language is not used in a vacuum but is deeply embedded in social interactions.

                    Phonetics deals with the actual sounds of human speech, which are created physically using the vocal tract, including the tongue, throat, lips, and lungs. It encompasses three sub-disciplines: articulatory phonetics (how the vocal tract produces sounds), auditory phonetics (how we perceive these sounds), and acoustic phonetics (the physical properties of sounds). Through studying these aspects, phonetics helps us understand the wide variety of sounds humans can produce and how these sounds differentiate languages and dialects.
